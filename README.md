# AI Chatbot Using GPT-2 and Django

#### Description:

This project is a simple AI chatbot built using the GPT-2 model and Django. The chatbot runs on a basic website where users can type a message and get a reply generated by GPT-2. The GPT-2 model is downloaded and run locally on my computer, so no external API calls are needed.

### What the Project Does

The website has a chat box where users enter text prompts. When you send a message, the website sends it to the backend. The backend uses GPT-2 to generate a response and sends it back to be shown on the webpage. This lets users have a conversation with the AI chatbot in real-time.

### Why I Made It This Way

I wanted to make a chatbot without relying on paid API services like OpenAI’s GPT-4 because I only had a free account. Running GPT-2 locally was the best option even though it’s a smaller model and a bit slower. I used Django to build the website because it’s simple and easy to manage both the frontend and backend.

### How the Project is Organized

- **`manage.py`**: This file helps run the website and manage the project.
- **`chatbot_project/settings.py`**: Contains settings like which apps are used and where templates are.
- **`chatbot_project/urls.py`**: Routes web requests to the chatbot app.
- **`chatbot_app/views.py`**: Handles the webpage display and the chatbot API that generates replies using GPT-2.
- **`chatbot_app/urls.py`**: Defines URLs for the chat page and API.
- **`chatbot_app/templates/chat.html`**: The webpage that users see to chat with the bot.

### How It Works

When you type a message, the frontend sends it to the backend API. The backend converts the text into a format GPT-2 understands, asks GPT-2 to generate a reply, and then sends that reply back to the webpage. GPT-2 runs on PyTorch, which lets the model work locally on my computer.

### What I Learned and Challenges

- Running GPT-2 on my local machine is slower than using cloud services.
- Using Django REST Framework helped make the API easier to build.
- The website design is simple and focuses on the chatbot feature.
- I did not deploy the site online yet, but it works well locally.

---

### What Can Be Improved

- Use better models if API access or hardware becomes available.
- Make the chat interface nicer and save chat history.
- Add user accounts to save conversations.
- Deploy the site so others can use it online.

### Final Thoughts

This project shows how to build a simple AI chatbot with GPT-2 and Django without relying on cloud APIs. It’s a good starting point for learning how to connect AI models with web apps.
